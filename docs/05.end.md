## 05. Where to go from here

### Full deploy

The last step here would be to deploy the application. With Vercel it's just a matter of running:

```bash
$ vercel
-- or --
$ vercel --prod
```

and in a matter of seconds we will have all of our code running on a public accessible url.

On different platforms things may be slightly different, and if your not using a CI/CD integrations you will definetely need to run

```bash
$ npm run build
```

locally before deploying. But remember that to deploy a SSR application we **need** a server running Node.js, [more details can be found in the docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

### Static deploy

If you want to deploy a SSG solution, like the blog generated from API that we created in the first guide, you will have to run two commands:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npx next export
```

the `export` command is the one responsible of generating the `.html` & co files so if you plan to run it often a nice idea may be to take advantage of the `package.json`'s scripts:

```json
{
  ...
  "build:static": "next build",
  "postbuildbuild:static": "next export",
  ...
}
```

so by running a single command you will get the second script running subsequentially

```bash
$ npm run build:static
```

at this point you will have an `/out` folder containing the static build that can be deployed in whatever hosting powered by a webserver that you prefer, most notable [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which comes for free with every public repo. If you choose this option you may also want to add [a simple GH Actions file](https://github.com/moebiusmania/salvatorelaisa.blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to automatically build and publish a static website at each commit on your repository.
