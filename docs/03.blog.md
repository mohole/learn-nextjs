# Learn Next.js

## 03. Create a SSG blog using a WordPress as a source

Now to get the basics of Next.js and a simple custom integration, we will build an SSG blog by pulling data from a WordPress blog (_thanks to WordPress built-in REST APIs_).

The objectives are:

- the blog will be server side rendered at build time, so that the final output could be eventually published on any hosting
- the pages will be hard-coded in the project
- the post will be dynamically generated from the source

1. first of all, copy the `types/pages.ts` file from this repo since it contains a rough typing of the WordPress post entity, and it's quite annoying to write it from scratch.
