# Learn Next.js

## 02. Setup of the evinronment

1. Create a new Next.js project with Typescript ([docs](https://nextjs.org/docs#automatic-setup))

```bash
$ npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

2. Add TailwindCSS [as described in the docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) and the following plugins:

- [Typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin#installation)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/)

3. install NPM packages with they're own TS typings:

- LowDB

```bash
$ npm i lowdb
$ npm i -D @types/lowdb
```

- uuid

```bash
$ npm i uuid
$ npm i -D @types/uuid
```

- sanitize-html

```bash
$ npm i sanitize-html
$ npm i -D @types/sanitize-html
```

4. now we can remove some parts of the starting boilerplate that aren't needed anymore, starting from the CSS

- delete `styles/Home.module.css`
- delete the CSS module import and the `className`s from `pages/index.tsx`

5. Just to check if at this point everything is fine, just add
   `className="container mx-auto py-5"`
   to the top level `<div>` tag in `pages/index.tsx`. You should see the content centered in the page

6. To set the theme for DaisyUI we need to ad an attribute to the `<html>` tag but we don't have any `.html` file... in that case [Next.js offers us a speciale file](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document), so let's create an `pages/_document.tsx` and the following content from the docs plus the DaisyUI theme attribute

```typescript
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html data-theme="corporate">
      <Head />
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

Now we have everything in place to start moving to next chapters...
