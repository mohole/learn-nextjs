The progeny of two brilliant parents; His mother, an Oxford Educated Professor of Comparative Mythology, his father, a self-taught software Engineer, it was clear from an early age that Sir Peter’s capabilities would only be eclipsed by his ambition to realize them. By the age of fourteen, he had already registered a dozen patents in a wide range of fields from biotech to robotics, but it would be his dynamic break-throughs in generating synthetic atmosphere above the polar ice cap that gained him worldwide recognition and spawned an empire.</p>\n<p>In less than a decade, Weyland Corporation became a worldwide leader in emerging technologies and launched the first privatized industrial mission to leave the planet Earth. “There are other worlds than this one,” Sir Peter boldly declared, “And if there is no air to breathe, we will simply have to make it.”</p>\n</p></div>\n</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sidebar-item\">\n<ul class=\"sidebar-tabs clearfix\">\n<li class=\"active\"><a href=\"\">Where to go next</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"sidebar-inner\">\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2012/02/28/writing-a-tedtalk-from-the-future-q-a-with-damon-lindelof\">Q&amp;A with screenwriter Damon Lindelof &raquo;</a></p>\n<p>If you liked Mr. Weyland&#8217;s talk from the future, we think you&#8217;ll enjoy these TEDTalks from <em>this</em> decade.
