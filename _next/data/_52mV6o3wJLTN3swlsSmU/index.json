Whether you&#8217;re scrolling through Facebook, hailing cars via Uber or booking a vacation on Airbnb, each business uses unique elements to win over consumers &#8212; oftentimes, with trust as their foundation. How can companies design with trust in mind? Sharing findings from a study that analyzed trust in business ecosystems, Marcos Aguiar offers a toolbox to building systemic trust that consists of seven elements: access; contracts with formalized terms and conditions; incentives to cooperate; control, or gentle guidance, that shapes behavior; transparency; intermediation; and mitigation when mishaps occur. While not all companies need every tool, he says, many will benefit greatly from three to six of them, depending on their industry. Aguiar encourages us all to consider the role trust plays in the platforms we use &#8212; and how it can improve our lives beyond them, too.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Anu Puusa</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, co-op enthusiast</span></p>\n<p><b>Big idea</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Cooperatives &#8212; businesses or other enterprises jointly owned, operated and controlled by their members &#8212; represent a sustainable model that can achieve long-term social, economic and environmental goals.</span></p>\n<p><b>How?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Cooperatives, also known as co-ops, are the invisible giant of the global economy, says Anu Puusa. Worldwide, there are more than three million co-ops, made up of one billion members, employing 280 million people and selling more than two trillion dollars in goods and services. How exactly do they work? Unlike most businesses, in which certain owners can buy power and influence, a co-op is fully owned by its members, who are also its customers and decision-makers. Each member has one vote, making each member an equal partner and owner in the business &#8212; whether the co-op is a farm, grocery store, bank, water supplier or any other organization. Co-ops find that sweet spot between for-profit businesses and the nonprofit world, Puusa says: while they do aim to make money, they also center members&#8217; social and environmental goals and hope to anchor wealth in a community across generations. Because co-ops think in the long term rather than quarter to quarter, creating a sustainable business is the top priority. &#8220;Unlike capitalism, the cooperative movement is not broken,&#8221; Puusa says. &#8220;It just needs better marketing.&#8221;</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_113099\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113099\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-113099\" src=\"https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg 5120w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=250,141 250w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=530,298 530w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=283,160 283w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=185,104 185w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_KiranMazumdar-Shaw_0003_logo.jpg?resize=73,42 73w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-113099\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Biotech pioneer Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw talks about equitable access to health care, the Indian biopharma industry and the essential role of international cooperation during the pandemic.

Unlike many governments worldwide, the pharmaceutical industry formed key partnerships at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, which enabled the rapid development of vaccines and facilitated a wide-ranging distribution effort. Small biotech companies, such as BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax were first to create innovative vaccine programs when the virus hit. Importantly, they partnered with established pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson to fund, license and develop the vaccines and tap into the necessary networks and supply chains to distribute them. What&#8217;s more, Mazumdar-Shaw says, these &#8220;big Pharma&#8221; companies then partnered with each other to overcome production and manufacturing limitations and supply the world with millions of doses. From these partnerships, as well as equitable distribution initiatives like Cepi, COVAX and the Gates Foundation, she says, we&#8217;ve seen growing support for equitable access to health care.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Jens Burchardt</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, climate impact advocate</span></p>\n<p><b>Big idea:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Saving the planet doesn&#8217;t have to break the bank. By spending one to two percent more on eco-friendly products, consumers can help shift industries towards massively smaller (or non-existent) carbon footprints.</span></p>\n<p><b>How? </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The steel industry is a highly competitive market &#8212; and a massive emitter of greenhouse gases. From the outset, the cost of transforming steelmaking into a low-carbon process would seem too high and potentially risky for suppliers. Jens Burchardt brings a fresh perspective to the challenge, walking us through the ins and outs of production in &#8220;hard-to-abate&#8221; (or energy-intensive) sectors. By tweaking the price consumers pay for products, he says, the world could take a huge step forward in lowering carbon emissions &#8212; and it may not be as expensive as we think. Using the example of an average European midsize sedan (which sells for approximately 30,000 euros), Burchardt breaks down the cost of materials &#8212; separate from assembly, marketing and other aspects of production &#8212; and calculates that it makes up only fifteen percent of the car&#8217;s total price. Companies could employ a low-carbon supplier and market their product as eco-friendly &#8212; for only 500 extra euros for consumers at the point of sale. For many industries, a greener world may not be as unreachable as once thought.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_113095\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113095\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-113095\" src=\"https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg 5120w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=250,141 250w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=530,298 530w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=283,160 283w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=185,104 185w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_NomavaZanazo_0001_logo.jpg?resize=73,42 73w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-113095\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Want to do business in Africa? Emerging markets expert Nomava Zanazo shares four things companies need to understand about African customers. She speaks at TED@BCG on April 8, 2021. (Photo courtesy of TED)</p></div>\n<p><b>Nomava Zanazo</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, emerging markets expert</span></p>\n<p><b>Big idea:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> A message to businesses: stop assuming and get to know African consumers before you sell to them.</span></p>\n<p><b>How?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> When looking to sell a new product or service in a country&#8217;s market, companies seek to understand the consumer base before jumping in, inquiring about aspects like shopping habits and brand loyalty. But when it comes to the African continent, they seem to abandon these considerations and lump assumptions broadly across its hyper-diverse 55 countries. Emerging markets expert (and South African) Nomava Zanazo gives a crash course on the everyday African spender. For example, Africans don&#8217;t want the cheapest product lines &#8212; but they do value brands and are much tech savvier than they&#8217;re given credit for. By debunking these misconceptions and myths, Zanazo encourages businesses to respect the African market and stop underestimating its consumers. Want your business to thrive in Africa? &#8220;Do the homework,&#8221; she says. &#8220;My continent is worth it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Nadya Bartol</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, cybersecurity leader</span></p>\n<p><b>Big idea</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: We must remove the shame around cybersecurity mistakes in order to have safe digital lives.</span></p>\n<p><b>How?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> We like to think of ourselves as confident and tech-savvy digital citizens. But many of us have accidentally downloaded a virus, been phished or had our identities stolen. Even software developers sometimes write insecure code without realizing it. These mistakes shouldn&#8217;t be hidden but highlighted in order to thwart future cybersecurity attacks, says Nadya Bartol &#8212; and we must start by lifting the shame. Much of modern life is computerized, from cars we drive to pacemakers that save lives, and anything digitally interconnected can be hacked. How do we truly stay safe in a digital world? Bartol suggests positive reinforcement and celebrated accountability to foster better, healthier cultures of cybersecurity. Only by being open and honest can we create an environment to learn, grow and protect ourselves in our hyperconnected world.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Beth Ford</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, farmer&#8217;s advocate, in conversation with TED business curator </span><b>Corey Hajim</b></p>\n<p><b>Big idea</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: US farmers face a wide range of challenges &#8212; from spotty broadband access to mounting climate disruptions. But there are also a variety of exciting solutions aimed at building 21st-century resilience. </span></p>\n<p><b>How?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> As the CEO of Land O&#8217;Lakes, Beth Ford works to create a future for farmers that&#8217;s both environmentally and economically sustainable. Among many initiatives, she&#8217;s focused on expanding technology infrastructure, specifically by pushing for greater broadband access in rural areas. Many farming communities have little to no internet access, leaving children without remote learning opportunities and farmers without modern agricultural tech that requires bandwidth to operate. Ford is speaking with governments and other stakeholders in order to make broadband access a priority &#8212; and establish it as a basic right nationwide. She&#8217;s also helping farmers build out sustainable business practices in the face of climate volatility. Her team&#8217;s agronomists, for instance, work with farmers to get acre-by-acre insights into soil health; they&#8217;re also helping establish carbon credits, whereby farmers who reduce their carbon emissions can sell those offsets to other industries. It&#8217;s a climate-friendly approach that&#8217;s also profitable, Ford says &#8212; part of a wave of initiatives aimed at making farmers part of the solution.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_113100\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113100\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-113100\" src=\"https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg 5120w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=250,141 250w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=530,298 530w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=283,160 283w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=185,104 185w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/TED@BCG_2021_AdamGrant_0014_logo.jpg?resize=73,42 73w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-113100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">We spend a lot of time trying to gain mastery over a set of skills or knowledge base.

The COVID-19 pandemic shuttered offices and strong-armed a reliance on remote work, teaching companies important lessons about their employees and their businesses. On the one-year anniversary of the start of the coronavirus lockdown, McCord reflects on four essential learnings that have the potential to improve work-life for everyone &#8212; even after the pandemic is over. After taking Zoom calls alongside our kids at the kitchen table, we’ve learned that separating work from family life is crucial to our productivity. Additionally, bosses have gained trust in their employees working from home, allowing them to make more autonomous decisions and focus on the results that matter. Companies have thrown &#8220;best practices&#8221; out the window and begun developing better business structures. And everyone has learned the true value of clear communication, which ensures efficiency. By understanding these key learnings, we can begin to rethink all the ways we work &#8212; and create new practices that work for everyone.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<div id=\"attachment_112936\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-112936\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-112936\" src=\"https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg 5120w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=250,141 250w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=530,298 530w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=283,160 283w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=185,104 185w, https://blog.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/TEDSalon_DWEN_2021_NatsaiAudreyChieza_0010_logo.jpg?resize=73,42 73w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-112936\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“We tend to recognize things and not the complex systems that actually produce them,” says designer Natsai Audrey Chieza.

She founded Faber Futures, an innovation lab and creative agency that brings together experts from different disciplines to explore the intersection of biology, design and technology. She shares creations that came from unexpected collaborations &#8212; between Afro-futurists and astrobiologists, food researchers and Indigenous campaigners.

We wrap up a lot of different feelings into the word “stress”: isolation, grief, anger, economic insecurity, existential anguish, prolonged uncertainty. So we must start by breaking it down into parts, naming and framing the different aspects. A major one, Perel says, is the loss of “eros”: the serendipity, surprise and mystery that lit up our pre-pandemic lives. (People are working hard to recapture eros at home, Perel says, with activities like baking bread and adopting puppies.) Likewise, the boundaries that once demarcated our lives &#8212; between work and home, coworker and spouse &#8212; have evaporated, leaving us without a sense of groundedness. So what are we to do? Be intentional about creating routines, rituals and boundaries, Perel says, and work to integrate these multiple realities, rather than hiding them. (For instance: don&#8217;t stress if your kid walks on camera during a work meeting and says hello. It&#8217;s natural!) What&#8217;s more, Perel says she’s noticed a shift towards “anti-small talk” at work: things people normally didn’t talk about at the office, like family and mental health, are now regularly entering into conversation.

TED is a nonprofit. The pandemic has cancelled our conferences and forced cuts on our sponsoring partners. So for the first time in our 34-year history, we’re turning to you, our global online audience, to ask you to consider supporting TED financially. We’re suggesting a monthly contribution of $5. If this is unaffordable right now, you can choose to pay whatever you wish. Your contribution will make a huge difference to our ability to present ideas that matter &#8212; in short videos, podcasts, animated lessons, and TV programs, translated into 100+ languages and distributed worldwide. It will also enable our ability to support more than 3,000 independently run TEDx events on every continent as well as </span><strong><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TED initiatives</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that contribute to sharing ideas to a global audience. Every dollar we receive is reinvested in this mission.</span></p>\n<p>So please consider giving this a try. There will be special events with stars from the TED stage, including neuroscientist Lisa Genova, author Pico Iyer, media trailblazer Pat Mitchell and photographer Angélica Dass. We’ll host intimate conversations with changemakers like Reshma Saujani, founder/CEO of Girls Who Code, and Tshering Tobgay, president of the People’s Democratic Party in Bhutan. For a peek at the calendar for the next few weeks, <strong><a href=\"http://ted.com/membership?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=membership-ted&amp;utm_content=03012021-blog#events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">look here</a></strong>.

That you can&#8217;t “boost” your immune system?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With humor and wit, Dr. Jen Gunter, a celebrated OB/GYN, pain medicine physician and </span><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jen_gunter_why_can_t_we_talk_about_periods?language=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TED speaker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, aims to share accurate, evidence-based medical information in a fun and accessible way.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Season 1 launches May 2021)</span></i></p>\n<p><b><i>Lost Birds with Mona Chalabi</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From COVID to electoral politics, people are turning to data to make sense of the world as never before. But how well do we understand what those numbers actually mean? Interpreting data has never been more timely or relevant to fight misinformation and understand the world around us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this original, sound-rich series, data scientist Mona Chalabi will take listeners on an inquiry into the central question: How can we use data to make sense of our lived experiences, and what are the limits of that data? Along the way, she will tackle urgent, random and sometimes deeply personal questions: How does Google calculate walking speeds? What happens when cities get louder? When will my heartache end?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Season 1 launches June 2021)</span></i></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/ConversationsAg\"><b><i>Conversations with People Who Hate Me</i></b></a><b><i> </i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TED </span><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/dylan_marron_empathy_is_not_endorsement?language=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">alum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Dylan Marron is joining the TED Audio Collective to continue exploring what happens when online feuders step out from behind the keyboard and get to know the human on the other side of the screen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In an internet era characterized by comment section wars, devastating clapbacks and anonymous vitriol, Dylan Marron connects people who have clashed online &#8212; from old friends to complete strangers &#8212; to explore why we believe what we believe, how we relate to each other on the internet and just what a phone call can accomplish.

They are allowed to spend the money however they wish: on personal needs or dreams, or by paying some or all of it forward to others. All they have to do is report back to us how and when they spend the money over the next three months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One group of applicants is being encouraged to share the discussion about how to spend the money with their followers on Twitter.

We are following informed consent, privacy and best industry practices based on academic standards to conduct this project. We won&#8217;t be publishing the results for at least six months, and until then we can’t say too much more about all this without potentially biasing the experiment. So for now, please just think of this as an imaginative project that we hope will contribute to social science in significant ways.
