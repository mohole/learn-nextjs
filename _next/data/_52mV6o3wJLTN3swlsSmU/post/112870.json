We’d be nothing without our global community of lifelong learners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have something new and truly special to offer you. A <a href=\"http://ted.com/membership?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=membership-ted&amp;utm_content=03012021-blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>membership</strong></a> that can take your engagement with TED to a whole new level: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discover exclusive live online events that feature an incredible new TED Talk ahead of its release, with the opportunity to ask the speaker questions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participate in off-the-record ask-me-anything sessions with your favorite TED speakers.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get to know other members in intimate TED Circles.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be part of an online community defined not by outrage and division, but by a desire to help build a better future.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re creating these special new features of TED as a way to connect more deeply with our most dedicated fans. TED is a nonprofit. The pandemic has cancelled our conferences and forced cuts on our sponsoring partners. So for the first time in our 34-year history, we’re turning to you, our global online audience, to ask you to consider supporting TED financially. We’re suggesting a monthly contribution of $5. If this is unaffordable right now, you can choose to pay whatever you wish. Your contribution will make a huge difference to our ability to present ideas that matter &#8212; in short videos, podcasts, animated lessons, and TV programs, translated into 100+ languages and distributed worldwide. It will also enable our ability to support more than 3,000 independently run TEDx events on every continent as well as </span><strong><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TED initiatives</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that contribute to sharing ideas to a global audience. Every dollar we receive is reinvested in this mission.</span></p>\n<p>So please consider giving this a try. There will be special events with stars from the TED stage, including neuroscientist Lisa Genova, author Pico Iyer, media trailblazer Pat Mitchell and photographer Angélica Dass. We’ll host intimate conversations with changemakers like Reshma Saujani, founder/CEO of Girls Who Code, and Tshering Tobgay, president of the People’s Democratic Party in Bhutan. For a peek at the calendar for the next few weeks, <strong><a href=\"http://ted.com/membership?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=membership-ted&amp;utm_content=03012021-blog#events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">look here</a></strong>. These are experiences you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can <strong><a href=\"http://ted.com/membership?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=membership-ted&amp;utm_content=03012021-blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">become a member here</a></strong></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and cancel anytime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks for listening.
